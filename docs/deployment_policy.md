# Deployment Policy and Compartments

Deployment Policy provides fine-grained control over how Skyhook rolls out updates across your cluster by defining **compartments** — groups of nodes selected by labels — with different rollout strategies and budgets.

---

## Overview

A **DeploymentPolicy** is a Kubernetes Custom Resource that separates rollout configuration from the Skyhook Custom Resource, allowing you to:
- Reuse the same policy across multiple Skyhooks
- Apply different strategies to different node groups (e.g., production vs. test)
- Control rollout speed and safety with configurable thresholds

**Important**: DeploymentPolicy controls **all node updates** in a Skyhook rollout, not just interrupt handling.

---

## Basic Structure

```yaml
apiVersion: skyhook.nvidia.com/v1alpha1
kind: DeploymentPolicy
metadata:
  name: my-policy
spec:
  # Reset batch state automatically when rollout completes or spec version changes
  resetBatchStateOnCompletion: true  # default: true
  # Default applies to nodes that don't match any compartment
  default:
    budget:
      percent: 100  # or count: N
    strategy:
      fixed:        # or linear, exponential
        initialBatch: 1
        batchThreshold: 100
        safetyLimit: 50
  # Compartments define specific node groups
  compartments:
  - name: production
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        env: production
    budget:
      percent: 25  # Scales with cluster size
    strategy:
      exponential:
        initialBatch: 1
        growthFactor: 2
        batchThreshold: 100
        failureThreshold: 1
        safetyLimit: 50
```

## Core Concepts

### Compartments
A named group of nodes selected by labels with:
- **Selector**: Kubernetes `LabelSelector` to match nodes
- **Budget**: Maximum nodes in progress at once (count or percent)
- **Strategy**: Rollout pattern (fixed, linear, or exponential)

### Budgets
Defines the ceiling for concurrent nodes:
- **Count**: Fixed number (e.g., `count: 3`)
- **Percent**: Percentage of matched nodes (e.g., `percent: 25`)

**Rounding for Percent**: `ceiling = max(1, int(matched_nodes × percent / 100))`
- Always rounds **down**
- Minimum is **1** (unless 0 nodes match)

**Examples**:
| Matched Nodes | Percent | Ceiling |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| 10 | 25% | 2 |
| 10 | 30% | 3 |
| 5 | 10% | 1 (rounds down from 0.5, then max(1, 0)) |
| 100 | 1% | 1 |

## Rollout Strategies

### Fixed Strategy
Constant batch size throughout the rollout.

```yaml
strategy:
  fixed:
    initialBatch: 5      # Always process 5 nodes
    batchThreshold: 100  # Require 100% success
    failureThreshold: 3  # Stop after 3 consecutive failures
    safetyLimit: 50      # Apply failure threshold only below 50% progress
```

**Use when**: You want predictable, safe rollouts.

---

### Linear Strategy
Increases by delta on success, decreases on failure.

```yaml
strategy:
  linear:
    initialBatch: 1
    delta: 1             # Increase by 1 each success
    batchThreshold: 100
    failureThreshold: 3
    safetyLimit: 50
```

**Progression** (delta=1): `1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5`

**Use when**: You want gradual ramp-up with slowdown on failures.

---

### Exponential Strategy
Multiplies by growth factor on success, divides on failure.

```yaml
strategy:
  exponential:
    initialBatch: 1
    growthFactor: 2      # Double on success
    batchThreshold: 100
    failureThreshold: 2
    safetyLimit: 50
```

**Progression** (factor=2): `1 → 2 → 4 → 8 → 16`

**Use when**: You want fast rollouts in large clusters with high confidence.

---

## Strategy Parameters

All strategies share these parameters:

- **`initialBatch`** (≥1): Starting number of nodes (default: 1)
- **`batchThreshold`** (1-100): Minimum success percentage to continue (default: 100)
- **`failureThreshold`** (≥1, optional): Max consecutive failures before stopping (default: none/unlimited)
- **`safetyLimit`** (1-100): Progress threshold for failure handling (default: 50)

### Default Values

When strategy parameters are not specified, the operator applies these defaults:
- `initialBatch`: 1
- `batchThreshold`: 100
- `safetyLimit`: 50
- `failureThreshold`: **none** (rollout never stops due to consecutive failures)

**Note**: `failureThreshold` is **nullable**. If omitted, the rollout will continue despite consecutive failures, only respecting batch success thresholds but never stopping the entire rollout.

### Safety Limit Behavior

**Before safetyLimit** (e.g., < 50% progress):
- Failures count toward `failureThreshold` (if set)
- Batch sizes slow down (linear/exponential)
- Reaching `failureThreshold` stops the rollout (if set)

**After safetyLimit** (e.g., ≥ 50% progress):
- Rollout continues despite failures
- Batch sizes don't slow down
- `failureThreshold` is ignored (rollout assumed "safe enough" to complete)

**Rationale**: Early failures indicate a problem. Late failures are less critical since most nodes are updated.

## Selectors and Node Matching

Compartments use standard Kubernetes label selectors:

### Match Labels
```yaml
selector:
  matchLabels:
    env: production
    tier: frontend
```

---

## Overlapping Selectors

When a node matches **multiple compartments**, the operator uses a **safety heuristic** to choose the safest one.

### Tie-Breaking Algorithm (3 levels)

1. **Strategy Safety**: Prefer safer strategies
   - **Fixed** (safest) > **Linear** > **Exponential** (least safe)

2. **Effective Ceiling**: If strategies are the same, prefer smaller ceiling
   - Smaller ceiling = fewer nodes at risk

3. **Lexicographic**: If still tied, alphabetically by compartment name
   - Ensures deterministic behavior

### Example

```yaml
compartments:
- name: us-west
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      region: us-west
  budget:
    count: 20         # Ceiling = 20
  strategy:
    exponential: {}

- name: production
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      env: production
  budget:
    count: 10         # Ceiling = 10 (smaller)
  strategy:
    linear: {}

- name: critical
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      priority: critical
  budget:
    count: 3
  strategy:
    fixed: {}         # Fixed (safest)
```

**Node with labels** `region=us-west, env=production, priority=critical`:
- Matches all three compartments
- **Winner**: `critical` (fixed strategy is safest)

**Node with labels** `region=us-west, env=production`:
- Matches `us-west` (exponential) and `production` (linear)
- **Winner**: `production` (linear is safer than exponential)

## Batch State Reset

When using progressive rollout strategies (linear, exponential), the operator tracks batch processing state per compartment — current batch number, consecutive failures, completed/failed node counts, etc. This state persists across reconciliations so the rollout can scale up progressively.

However, when a rollout **completes** or a **spec version changes**, you typically want the next rollout to start fresh from batch 1 rather than continuing with scaled-up batch sizes. Batch state reset handles this automatically.

### Auto-Reset Triggers

Batch state is automatically reset when **either** of these events occurs (if configured):

1. **Rollout completion** — When a Skyhook's status transitions to `Complete`
2. **Spec version change** — When a package version changes in the Skyhook spec

After reset, the next reconciliation starts from batch 1 with all counters cleared.

### Configuration

Auto-reset is controlled by two fields with a precedence hierarchy:

| Field | Location | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `spec.resetBatchStateOnCompletion` | DeploymentPolicy | Default setting for all Skyhooks using this policy |
| `spec.deploymentPolicyOptions.resetBatchStateOnCompletion` | Skyhook | Per-Skyhook override (takes precedence) |

**Precedence order** (highest to lowest):
1. Skyhook's `deploymentPolicyOptions.resetBatchStateOnCompletion`
2. DeploymentPolicy's `resetBatchStateOnCompletion`
3. Default: `true` (safe by default for new resources)

### Examples

**Enable auto-reset (default behavior for new policies)**:
```yaml
apiVersion: skyhook.nvidia.com/v1alpha1
kind: DeploymentPolicy
metadata:
  name: my-policy
spec:
  resetBatchStateOnCompletion: true  # Enabled by default
  default:
    budget:
      percent: 25
```

**Disable auto-reset for a specific Skyhook** (override the policy):
```yaml
apiVersion: skyhook.nvidia.com/v1alpha1
kind: Skyhook
metadata:
  name: my-skyhook
spec:
  deploymentPolicy: my-policy
  deploymentPolicyOptions:
    resetBatchStateOnCompletion: false  # Override: keep batch state across rollouts
```

**Disable auto-reset at the policy level**:
```yaml
apiVersion: skyhook.nvidia.com/v1alpha1
kind: DeploymentPolicy
metadata:
  name: preserve-state-policy
spec:
  resetBatchStateOnCompletion: false  # All Skyhooks using this policy keep batch state
```

### Manual Reset

You can also reset batch state manually using the CLI:

```bash
# Reset batch state for a specific Skyhook
kubectl skyhook deployment-policy reset my-skyhook --confirm

# Preview what would be reset (dry-run)
kubectl skyhook deployment-policy reset my-skyhook --dry-run

# The 'reset' command also resets batch state by default
kubectl skyhook reset my-skyhook --confirm

# To reset nodes only without resetting batch state
kubectl skyhook reset my-skyhook --skip-batch-reset --confirm
```

See [CLI documentation](cli.md) for full command details.

## Using with Skyhooks

Reference a policy by name:

```yaml
apiVersion: skyhook.nvidia.com/v1alpha1
kind: Skyhook
metadata:
  name: my-skyhook
spec:
  deploymentPolicy: my-policy  # References DeploymentPolicy
  deploymentPolicyOptions:     # Optional per-Skyhook overrides
    resetBatchStateOnCompletion: true
  nodeSelectors:
    matchLabels:
      workload: gpu
  packages:
    # ...
```

**Behavior**:
- DeploymentPolicy is **cluster-scoped** (not namespaced)
- Each node is assigned to a compartment based on selectors
- Nodes not matching any compartment use the `default` settings
- `deploymentPolicyOptions` allows per-Skyhook overrides of policy settings

---

## Migration from InterruptionBudget

The legacy `interruptionBudget` field is still supported but **DeploymentPolicy is recommended**.

### Before
```yaml
spec:
  interruptionBudget:
    percent: 25
```

### After
```yaml
# 1. Create DeploymentPolicy
apiVersion: skyhook.nvidia.com/v1alpha1
kind: DeploymentPolicy
metadata:
  name: legacy-equivalent
spec:
  default:
    budget:
      percent: 25
    strategy:
      fixed:
        initialBatch: 1
        batchThreshold: 100
        safetyLimit: 50
```

```yaml
# 2. Update Skyhook
spec:
  deploymentPolicy: legacy-equivalent
  # Remove interruptionBudget field
```

---

## Monitoring

Deployment Policy rollout behavior is exposed via Prometheus metrics. See [Metrics documentation](metrics/README.md) for details.

---

## Examples

See `/operator/config/samples/deploymentpolicy_v1alpha1_deploymentpolicy.yaml` for a complete sample showing:
- Critical nodes (count=1, fixed strategy)
- Production nodes (count=3, linear strategy)
- Staging nodes (percent=33, exponential strategy)
- Test nodes (percent=50, fast exponential)
