# NodeWright CLI

kubectl plugin for managing NodeWright deployments, packages, and nodes.

## Overview

The NodeWright CLI (`kubectl nodewright`) provides SRE tooling for managing NodeWright deployments and their packages across Kubernetes cluster nodes. It supports inspecting node/package state, forcing re-runs, managing node lifecycle, and retrieving logs.

## Compatibility

### Required API Group

This CLI targets the `nodewright.nvidia.com` API group and the `NodeWright`
kind, and it reads and writes `nodewright.nvidia.com/*` node annotations. It
requires an operator that serves `nodewright.nvidia.com`; older Skyhook-only
operators that serve just `skyhook.nvidia.com` and the `Skyhook` kind are
unsupported. Upgrade the operator to a NodeWright-capable version before using
this CLI.

Every cluster-backed command runs a preflight check on the served API groups.
If the cluster serves only the legacy `skyhook.nvidia.com` group and not
`nodewright.nvidia.com`, the command fails fast with a clear, actionable error
naming both groups and telling you to upgrade to a NodeWright-capable operator,
rather than a confusing `NotFound`.

### Minimum Operator Version

The CLI requires **operator version v0.8.0 or later** for full functionality of all commands.

### Command Compatibility Matrix

| Command | v0.7.x and earlier | v0.8.0+ |
|---------|-------------------|---------|
| `version` | ✅ Full | ✅ Full |
| `node status` | ✅ Full | ✅ Full |
| `node list` | ✅ Full | ✅ Full |
| `node reset` | ✅ Full | ✅ Full |
| `node ignore/unignore` | ✅ Full | ✅ Full |
| `package status` | ✅ Full | ✅ Full |
| `package rerun` | ✅ Full | ✅ Full |
| `package logs` | ✅ Full | ✅ Full |
| `reset` | ✅ Full | ✅ Full |
| `reset --package` | ✅ Full (v0.7.5+) | ✅ Full |
| `update-state` | ✅ Full (v0.7.5+) — see note | ✅ Full — see note |
| `deployment-policy reset` | ❌ Not supported | ✅ Full |
| `pause` | ❌ Not supported | ✅ Full — stop strength varies, see note |
| `resume` | ❌ Not supported | ✅ Full |
| `disable` | ❌ Not supported | ✅ Full |
| `enable` | ❌ Not supported | ✅ Full |

> **Note on `pause` stop strength:** the command works on every v0.8.0+ operator,
> but *how hard it stops* is version-dependent, so the column above is about
> availability only. On operators that run package stages as Jobs, pause suspends
> the stage that is currently executing. On v0.8.0+ operators that predate that
> change — and, briefly, for a stage still running as a pre-upgrade pod during the
> upgrade itself — pause blocks all *new* stage scheduling but lets an in-flight
> stage finish. (On v0.7.x and earlier the command does not exist at all; use
> `spec.pause`.) `disable` never stops in-flight work on any version. See
> [Emergency Stop](#emergency-stop) for the full semantics and for what `resume`
> re-runs.
>
> **Note on `update-state` and `reset --package`:** These commands edit the
> `nodewright.nvidia.com/nodeState_<nodewright>` annotation in-place. The
> annotation's `map[string]PackageStatus` shape has been stable since
> **operator v0.7.5**, and the CLI refuses to run against anything older.
> What *has* evolved across operator releases is the set of recognised
> stage and state values — for example `uninstall` and `uninstall-interrupt`
> were added in v0.16.0. Picking a stage/state your operator doesn't
> recognise will leave the package in a state the operator can't progress
> from. Confirm the stage/state values are valid for your operator before
> running these commands.

### Breaking Change: Pause/Disable Mechanism

In operator versions **v0.7.x and earlier**, pausing and disabling a Skyhook was done via spec fields:

```yaml
spec:
  pause: true  # Old method - no longer used by operator
```

Starting with **v0.8.0**, the operator uses **annotations** instead:

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    nodewright.nvidia.com/pause: "true"
    nodewright.nvidia.com/disable: "true"
```

The CLI's `pause`, `resume`, `disable`, and `enable` commands set these annotations. If you're running an older operator (v0.7.x or earlier), these commands will appear to succeed but the operator won't recognize the annotations - you'll need to edit the Skyhook spec directly using `kubectl edit`.

## Installation

```bash
# Build from source
cd operator
make build-cli

# Install as kubectl plugin
cp bin/nodewright /usr/local/bin/kubectl-nodewright # or another directory in $PATH with write access

# Verify installation
kubectl nodewright version
```

## Usage Structure

### Basic Command Structure

```
kubectl nodewright [global-flags] <command> [subcommand] [flags] [arguments]
```

### Global Flags

- `-h, --help` - Show help for any command
- `--version` - Show version information
- `-n, --namespace` - Kubernetes namespace (default: "skyhook")
- `-o, --output` - Output format: table|json|yaml|wide
- `-v, --verbose` - Enable verbose output
- `--dry-run` - Preview changes without applying them
- `--kubeconfig` - Path to kubeconfig file

## Commands

### Version Command

Show plugin and operator versions.

```bash
# Show both plugin and operator versions
kubectl nodewright version

# Show only plugin version (no cluster query)
kubectl nodewright version --client-only

# With custom timeout
kubectl nodewright version --timeout 10s
```

### Pause/Resume Commands

Control NodeWright processing state.

> **Note:** Requires operator v0.8.0+. See [Compatibility](#compatibility) for details.

```bash
# Pause a Skyhook (stops processing new nodes)
kubectl nodewright pause my-skyhook
kubectl nodewright pause my-skyhook --confirm  # Skip confirmation

# Resume a paused Skyhook
kubectl nodewright resume my-skyhook
```

### Disable/Enable Commands

Completely disable or re-enable a NodeWright.

> **Note:** Requires operator v0.8.0+. See [Compatibility](#compatibility) for details.

```bash
# Disable a Skyhook completely
kubectl nodewright disable my-skyhook
kubectl nodewright disable my-skyhook --confirm

# Re-enable a disabled Skyhook
kubectl nodewright enable my-skyhook
```

### Reset Command

Reset all package state for a NodeWright, causing re-execution from the beginning.

```bash
# Reset all nodes for a Skyhook (also resets batch state by default)
kubectl nodewright reset gpu-init --confirm

# Preview changes without applying (dry-run)
kubectl nodewright reset gpu-init --dry-run

# Reset nodes only, preserve deployment policy batch state
kubectl nodewright reset gpu-init --skip-batch-reset --confirm

# Reset only a single package across all tracked nodes
kubectl nodewright reset gpu-init --package pkg1:1.0 --confirm --skip-batch-reset
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--confirm, -y` | Skip confirmation prompt |
| `--skip-batch-reset` | Skip resetting deployment policy batch state |
| `--package <name>[:<version>]` | Reset only this package's state on each node |

> **Note:** By default, `reset` also resets the deployment policy batch state so the next rollout starts from batch 1, and clears node ordering state (`NodeOrderOffset` and `NodePriority`) so `SKYHOOK_NODE_ORDER` restarts from `0`. Use `--skip-batch-reset` to preserve the existing batch and ordering state.

#### `--package <name>[:<version>]`

When `--package` is set, `reset` removes only the named package's entry from
each node's `nodeState` annotation instead of removing the whole annotation:

- If `<version>` is supplied (e.g. `pkg1:1.0`), only entries whose recorded
  version matches are removed; nodes with the package at a different version
  are left untouched and reported in the command output.
- If the package was the last entry in the annotation, the entire annotation
  is removed (matching the behavior of a full reset).
- Batch state is **deliberately not reset** on this path regardless of
  `--skip-batch-reset`: restarting the full rollout from batch 1 to recover a
  single package would be disproportionate. Pair with
  `kubectl nodewright deployment-policy reset` explicitly if you also want to
  restart batches.

### Update-State Command

Edit the recorded state of a single package on NodeWright-managed nodes.
`update-state` performs a surgical edit to the per-node
`nodewright.nvidia.com/nodeState_<nodewright>` annotation — replacing (or, with
`--add`, inserting) one entry in the `map[string]PackageStatus` value. It is
an **administrator escape hatch** for recovering from stuck rollouts and
deliberately does *not* validate that the requested `(stage, state)`
combination is one the operator could legally produce, nor does it gate
destructive stages (`uninstall`, `uninstall-interrupt`) behind extra
prompts.

```bash
kubectl nodewright update-state <skyhook-name> <package> <version> <stage> <state>
```

> **⚠️ Pause the NodeWright before running `update-state`.**
>
> `update-state` performs a read-modify-write on the node-state annotation and
> uses a merge patch with no resource-version check. The patch rewrites the
> **entire** annotation value, not just the targeted package's entry — so a
> concurrent operator (or CLI) edit to any *other* package's entry in the
> same annotation will also be clobbered. If the operator reconciles the
> node between the CLI's read and write, the operator can immediately
> overwrite the manual edit — at best wasting the operation, at worst racing
> the operator into an inconsistent state. Always pause the NodeWright
> (`kubectl nodewright pause <name> --confirm`) before running this command,
> and resume only when finished.
>
> `update-state` also requires the package + version to still be present in
> `skyhook.Spec.Packages`. It cannot edit an *orphaned* node-state entry
> left behind after the package was removed from the spec — use `reset
> --package <name>[:<version>]` for that.

```bash
# Mark pkg1@1.0 as complete on every node that already tracks this Skyhook
kubectl nodewright update-state gpu-init pkg1 1.0 config complete --confirm

# Same, but only on one node
kubectl nodewright update-state gpu-init pkg1 1.0 config complete --node worker-1 --confirm

# Narrow to a label-selected set of nodes
kubectl nodewright update-state gpu-init pkg1 1.0 interrupt in_progress -l role=gpu --confirm

# Preview the changes without writing them
kubectl nodewright update-state gpu-init pkg1 1.0 config erroring --dry-run
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--node` | Limit the update to specific node(s); repeat for multiple |
| `--selector, -l` | Limit the update to nodes matching a label selector |
| `--confirm, -y` | Skip confirmation prompt |
| `--add` | Create a fresh `nodeState` entry on nodes that do not yet have one for this package; requires `--node` or `--selector` |

The global `--dry-run` flag is honored: the command prints the set of nodes
it would patch and exits without writing.

By default `update-state` targets only nodes that already have a `nodeState`
entry for the named NodeWright. If `--node` names a node that does not exist
or has no state for the NodeWright, the command warns and skips that node
rather than failing.

#### `--add`

`--add` creates a fresh `nodeState` entry on nodes that do not yet have one
for the given `<package>@<version>` — useful for bootstrapping state on a
node the operator has not visited yet, or for re-creating an entry that was
manually deleted.

`--add` **requires** either `--node` or `--selector` so the scope of the
creation is explicit. Without one of these flags, `--add` would apply to
every node in the cluster that matches the NodeWright's selector, which is
far too broad for a creation operation — the CLI rejects this combination
with an error.

If a targeted node already has an entry for `<package>@<version>`, `--add`
warns and skips that node (use `update-state` without `--add` if you intend
to overwrite the existing entry).

### Migrating manifests to NodeWright

There is no dedicated migrate command: the conversion is a mechanical group and
kind swap with no change to the spec body. Both `Skyhook` and `DeploymentPolicy`
change API group to `nodewright.nvidia.com/v1alpha1`; `Skyhook` additionally
changes its kind to `NodeWright`, while `DeploymentPolicy` keeps its kind. Any
`skyhook.nvidia.com/*` annotation or label keys become `nodewright.nvidia.com/*`.

For a source manifest, that is:

```bash
sed -e 's|skyhook\.nvidia\.com/|nodewright.nvidia.com/|g' \
    -e 's|kind: Skyhook|kind: NodeWright|' skyhook.yaml > nodewright.yaml
```

The operator's mirror controller already converts the live objects in the
cluster automatically; the edit above is only for the manifests in your source
of truth (git / GitOps). See
[docs/nodewright-migration.md](nodewright-migration.md) for the full flow.

### Deployment Policy Commands

Manage deployment policy batch state.

> **Note:** Requires operator v0.8.0+.

```bash
# Reset batch state for a Skyhook (starts rollout from batch 1)
kubectl nodewright deployment-policy reset gpu-init --confirm

# Preview what would be reset (dry-run)
kubectl nodewright deployment-policy reset gpu-init --dry-run

# Using the short alias
kubectl nodewright dp reset gpu-init --confirm
```

The `deployment-policy reset` command resets the batch processing state for all compartments in the specified NodeWright, including:

- Current batch number (reset to 1)
- Consecutive failure count
- Completed and failed node counts
- Stop flag
- Node ordering state (`NodeOrderOffset` and `NodePriority`) — `SKYHOOK_NODE_ORDER` restarts from `0`

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--confirm, -y` | Skip confirmation prompt |

**When to use**:

- After a rollout completes and you want to start a new rollout fresh
- When batch processing is stuck and needs to be reset
- Before re-running a rollout with the same deployment policy

See [Deployment Policy documentation](deployment_policy.md) for details on auto-reset configuration.

### Node Commands

Manage NodeWright nodes across the cluster.

```bash
# List all nodes targeted by a Skyhook
kubectl nodewright node list --nodewright my-nodewright
kubectl nodewright node list --nodewright my-nodewright -o json

# Show all Skyhook activity on specific node(s)
kubectl nodewright node status worker-1
kubectl nodewright node status worker-1 worker-2
kubectl nodewright node status "worker-.*"  # Regex pattern
kubectl nodewright node status worker-1 --nodewright my-nodewright  # Filter by NodeWright

# Reset all package state on node(s)
kubectl nodewright node reset worker-1 --nodewright my-nodewright --confirm
kubectl nodewright node reset "node-.*" --nodewright my-nodewright --dry-run

# Ignore/unignore nodes from processing
kubectl nodewright node ignore worker-1
kubectl nodewright node ignore "test-node-.*"
kubectl nodewright node unignore worker-1
```

## Help System

```bash
# General help
kubectl nodewright --help

# Command group help
kubectl nodewright node --help
kubectl nodewright package --help
kubectl nodewright deployment-policy --help

# Specific command help
kubectl nodewright node reset --help
kubectl nodewright package rerun --help
kubectl nodewright deployment-policy reset --help
```

## Common Usage Patterns

### Debugging a Failed Package

```bash
# 1. Check package status
kubectl nodewright package status my-package --nodewright my-nodewright -o wide

# 2. View logs for the failed package
kubectl nodewright package logs my-package --nodewright my-nodewright --node worker-1

# 3. Fix the issue, then force re-run
kubectl nodewright package rerun my-package --nodewright my-nodewright --node worker-1 --confirm
```

### Node Maintenance

```bash
# 1. Ignore node before maintenance
kubectl nodewright node ignore worker-1

# 2. Perform maintenance...

# 3. Unignore and reset to re-run all packages
kubectl nodewright node unignore worker-1
kubectl nodewright node reset worker-1 --nodewright my-nodewright --confirm
```

### Cluster-Wide Status Check

```bash
# List all nodes for a Skyhook
kubectl nodewright node list --nodewright my-nodewright

# Check status of all nodes
kubectl nodewright node status

# Check specific Skyhook across all nodes
kubectl nodewright node status --nodewright my-nodewright -o json
```

### Resetting a Rollout

```bash
# 1. Full reset: nodes + batch state (starts everything fresh)
kubectl nodewright reset my-skyhook --confirm

# 2. Or reset only batch state (keep node state, restart batch progression)
kubectl nodewright deployment-policy reset my-skyhook --confirm

# 3. Or reset only nodes (keep batch progression)
kubectl nodewright reset my-skyhook --skip-batch-reset --confirm
```

### Surgical Recovery

When a single package on a single node is wedged and a full reset is too
disruptive, pause the NodeWright, edit the recorded state directly, then
resume:

```bash
# 1. Pause so the operator doesn't clobber the manual edit
kubectl nodewright pause my-skyhook --confirm

# 2. Mark the wedged package as complete (or set whatever stage/state
#    you need to unblock the rollout)
kubectl nodewright update-state my-skyhook my-package 1.0 config complete \
    --node worker-1 --confirm

# 3. Resume processing
kubectl nodewright resume my-skyhook --confirm
```

For a single-package reset across all nodes (without disturbing the
deployment policy batch state), prefer `reset --package`:

```bash
kubectl nodewright reset my-skyhook --package my-package:1.0 --confirm
```

### Emergency Stop

> **Note:** Requires operator v0.8.0+. For older operators, use `kubectl edit skyhook my-skyhook` and set `spec.pause: true`.

**`pause` and `disable` stop different things.** `pause` is the one that can halt work already running: on operators that run package stages as Jobs it suspends the executing stage, and on older ones it blocks new scheduling only — see the version note below. `disable` takes the NodeWright out of processing so no *new* work is scheduled, but it does not stop a stage already under way; that stage runs to completion.

They compose safely in either order: disabling a paused NodeWright leaves its suspended stages suspended rather than resuming them. Those stages resume only once **both** annotations are cleared — re-enabling on its own does nothing while the NodeWright is still paused. If you want everything stopped *now*, `pause` is the command.

```bash
# Pause all processing
kubectl nodewright pause my-skyhook --confirm

# Or prevent new work being scheduled
kubectl nodewright disable my-skyhook --confirm
```

> **How hard pause stops depends on the operator version.** On operators that run
> package stages as Jobs, pause suspends the stage that is *currently executing* —
> its pod is signaled to stop and nothing new starts until you `resume`, at which
> point the stage re-runs from the start of its current phase (the agent skips
> already-completed steps). On earlier operators — and, briefly, for a stage still
> running as a pre-upgrade pod during an operator upgrade — a stage already in
> flight finishes its current run before pause takes hold; pause still blocks all
> *new* stage scheduling. If you need a running stage to stop immediately, confirm
> the operator executes packages as Jobs.

## Output Formats

All status commands support multiple output formats:

```bash
# Table (default) - human-readable
kubectl nodewright node list --nodewright my-nodewright

# Wide - table with additional columns
kubectl nodewright node list --nodewright my-nodewright -o wide

# JSON - machine-readable
kubectl nodewright node list --nodewright my-nodewright -o json

# YAML - machine-readable
kubectl nodewright node list --nodewright my-nodewright -o yaml
```
