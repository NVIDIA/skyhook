# Generate a per-component CHANGELOG.md from git history.
#
# Why this exists instead of a single `git-cliff --include-path ...` call:
# git-cliff path-filters the commit set FIRST, then looks for release tags only
# among the surviving commits. In this monorepo most release tags sit on commits
# that touch no files under the component's own path (chart bumps, CI fixes,
# cross-component features, ride-along agent releases) and some live only on
# release branches. git-cliff therefore silently drops those release sections and
# rolls their commits into [Unreleased]. See orhun/git-cliff#1122 and #208.
#
# Fix: the authoritative list of releases lives in `git tag`, not in the filtered
# commit walk. We take the release boundaries from `git tag` and ask git-cliff to
# render each section over an explicit `prevTag..curTag` range. `git log A..B`
# resolves across branches, so release-branch tags work as endpoints, and a tag
# whose commit was path-filtered is still a valid boundary. --include-path keeps
# doing its real job: choosing which commits appear *inside* each section.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/gen-changelog.sh <operator|agent|chart|cli> [next-version]
#
# Run with no args on a TTY for an interactive component/action picker.
#
# If [next-version] (e.g. v0.2.0) is given, commits since the latest tag are
# rendered as that version instead of [Unreleased] -- use this when cutting a
# release. Otherwise unreleased commits go under [Unreleased].
#
# Cutting a release also promotes the `## Unreleased` heading in the sibling
# RELEASE_NOTES.md to `## <component>/vX.Y.Z - <date>`, which is the heading the
# release workflows extract the human-authored release body from.
