# CRITICAL PROOF: Priority 1 and Priority 2 skyhooks running concurrently
# This proves per-node ordering - in the old global ordering system, ALL nodes had to finish priority 1 before ANY node could start priority 2
# Now we can have zzz (priority 1) and b (priority 2) running at the same time because nodes work independently
# Worker2 is on priority 1 (zzz) while Worker is on priority 2 (b)

# Skyhook zzz (priority 1) transitioning to in_progress (worker2 was just unblocked)
