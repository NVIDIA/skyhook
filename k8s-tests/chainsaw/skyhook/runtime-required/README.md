# Runtime Required Test

## Purpose

Validates per-node runtime-required behavior where each node's taint is removed independently when that node completes all runtime-required skyhooks.

## Test Scenario

The test explicitly validates node isolation by blocking one node while the other completes:

### Phase 1: Setup with Blocked Node
1. Label both worker nodes with the test label (`skyhook.nvidia.com/runtime-required-test=true`)
2. Add runtime-required taints to both nodes
3. **Add blocking taint to kind-worker2** only (`test-block=true:NoSchedule`)
4. Apply a runtime-required skyhook (does NOT tolerate the blocking taint)
5. Result: Only kind-worker can run; kind-worker2 is blocked

### Phase 2: Assert Node Isolation (Sequential Assertions)
6. Assert kind-worker completes with runtime-required taint removed
7. Assert kind-worker2 is still blocked with runtime-required taint STILL present
   - This sequential assertion proves per-node taint removal

### Phase 3: Unblock Second Node
8. Remove the blocking taint from kind-worker2

### Phase 4: Assert Node2 Completion
9. Assert kind-worker2 completes with runtime-required taint removed

### Phase 5: Final Validation
10. Assert both nodes complete (uses label selector for both nodes)

## Key Features Tested

- Per-node taint removal for runtime-required skyhooks
- Node isolation (one slow node doesn't block others)
- Multi-node runtime-required behavior
- Taint is removed based on individual node completion, not global skyhook completion

## Files

- `chainsaw-test.yaml` - Main test configuration with multi-phase flow
- `skyhook.yaml` - Runtime-required skyhook definition
- `assert-node1-complete-node2-blocked.yaml` - Sequential assertions: node1 complete, node2 blocked (proves isolation)
- `assert-node2-complete.yaml` - Assertion: node2 complete after unblocking
- `assert.yaml` - Final validation: both nodes complete

## Notes

- Uses dedicated label `skyhook.nvidia.com/runtime-required-test=true` to avoid conflicts with other tests
- Tests both worker nodes independently
