# Interrupt Test

## Purpose

Validates the interrupt feature of the nodewright operator, including pod draining, waiting, and interrupt budget enforcement.

## Test Scenario

1. Create pods on the node before applying the nodewright:
   - An invalid package pod
   - A pod to wait on
   - A pod to drain
2. Apply a nodewright that requires interrupting these workloads
3. Verify interrupt behavior:
   - Pods are drained according to the interrupt configuration
   - Wait-for pods block progress until ready
   - Invalid pods are handled correctly
4. Assert packages complete successfully after interrupts

## Key Features Tested

- Interrupt (drain) functionality
- Wait-for pod support
- Agent image override (`agentImageOverride`)
- Interruption budgets
- Package dependencies (`dependsOn`)

## Files

- `chainsaw-test.yaml` - Main test configuration with lifecycle assertions inline (pods, nodes, nodewright status) for sequential ordering
- `nodewright.yaml` - NodeWright with interrupt configuration
- `pod.yaml` - Pods to create before the nodewright (drain-on and important-stuff)
- `assert-important-stuff.yaml` - Assertion for the important-stuff pod (used to verify wait-for behavior)
- `assert-drain-me.yaml` - Assertion for the drain-on pod (used to verify drain behavior)
- `assert-cm-b.yaml` - ConfigMap assertions for final package state

## Notes

- This test cannot run concurrently with other tests because it can cause race conditions where other nodewrights make the node unschedulable
