controllerManager:
  ## tolerations: add tolerations to the controller manager pod
  ## Example below is for a system-cpu tainted node
  # tolerations:
  # - key: dedicated
  #   operator: "Equal"
  #   value: system-cpu
  #   effect: NoSchedule
  tolerations: []
  ## selectors: add simple node selectors to the controller manager pod
  ## Example below is for a system-workload node selector
  ## NOTE: Cannot be used together with nodeAffinity.matchExpressions
  # selectors:
  #   dedicated: system-workload
  selectors: {}
  ## nodeAffinity: add advanced node affinity expressions to the controller manager pod
  ## This allows for more complex node selection than simple selectors
  ## NOTE: Cannot be used together with selectors - choose one approach
  ## Example below shows how to select nodes with specific labels using expressions
  # nodeAffinity:
  #   matchExpressions:
  #   - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane
  #     operator: DoesNotExist
  #   - key: dedicated
  #     operator: In
  #     values:
  #     - system-workload
  #     - gpu-workload
  nodeAffinity:
    matchExpressions: []

## limitRange: is the limit range for the operator controller.
## This sets for all containers in the namespace.
## So if your package does not override the limits, these are what will be used.
## if you omit this, the we will not create a limit range.
