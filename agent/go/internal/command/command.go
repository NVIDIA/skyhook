// Package command executes operating-system commands with caller-controlled
// output handling and optional runner-level chroot isolation.
//
// Runner copies stdout and stderr concurrently into the writers supplied on
// each Command. The package writes raw bytes without adding timestamps,
// prefixes, or lifecycle policy, and it never closes caller-owned writers.
// Passing a bytes.Buffer captures output in memory; passing os.Stdout or a
// fan-out writer makes output visible as the process runs. Nil writers discard
// their corresponding output.
//
// Paths in WorkingDirectory, Executable, and PATH are interpreted inside the
// runner's chroot when it is constructed with WithChroot. A runner without
// WithChroot executes against the caller's normal filesystem.
//
// Production support is Linux only. The package relies on chroot, Unix process
// groups, and Unix signal semantics and does not provide a Windows implementation.
