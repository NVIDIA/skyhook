and troubleshoot Skyhook packages across your cluster nodes.

Packages are the core unit of work in Skyhook, representing containerized
operations that are applied to nodes matching selector criteria.

Available operations:
  - Force re-execution of packages on specific nodes
  - Query package status across the cluster
  - Retrieve package logs for debugging
  - Inspect package state and progress

Common use cases:
  - Re-running a failed package after fixing the underlying issue
  - Forcing package updates after configuration changes
  - Debugging package failures by examining logs and state
  - Monitoring package rollout progress across nodes`,
