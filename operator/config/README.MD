# Skyhook Operator Kustomize Config

This directory contains Kustomize manifests and overlays used for development and testing of the Skyhook operator.

**Note:**
- The only recommended installation method for production or end users is the [Helm chart](../../chart/README.md).
- The Kustomize setup here is primarily for local development, CI, and testing.
- If you are installing Skyhook in a real cluster, please use the Helm chart.
