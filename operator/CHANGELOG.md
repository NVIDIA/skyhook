# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### New Features

- Add `spec.drainConfig` so interrupt drains can tune eviction, direct deletion, emptyDir handling, unmanaged-pod handling, DaemonSet skipping, timeout, and grace-period behavior.

### Changed

- Align the default interrupt drain pod filter with Kubernetes drain semantics:
  already-terminating pods and mirror/static pods are skipped, unschedulable
  tolerations use Kubernetes `ToleratesTaint` matching, and DaemonSet pods are
  identified from the controller owner reference instead of the previous owner
  reference count heuristic.

## [operator/v0.16.1] - 2026-05-22

### Bug Fixes

- **Webhook serving-cert bootstrap deadlock on major upgrade.** During an
  upgrade from older versions, an old-version leader holding the main
  reconcile lease could deadlock the new webhook's serving-cert bootstrap
  and prevent the new controller from coming up. The bootstrap now runs
  under its own dedicated `ctrl.Manager` with a separate leader-election
  lease (`nodewright-webhook-bootstrap.nvidia.com`), so it no longer
  contends with the main reconcile lease and the upgrade proceeds even
  while the old leader still holds the primary lease (#243).

## [operator/v0.16.0] - 2026-05-19 — Explicit Uninstall

Introduces an opt-in declarative uninstall workflow and reworks how downgrades
and CR deletion behave. Affects the Operator, Webhook, and CRD.

### New Features

- Add a standard `Ready` condition to Skyhook status for native Kubernetes wait and GitOps health tooling.

### New behavior

- **`uninstall.enabled` / `uninstall.apply` on each package.** Setting
  `apply: true` (requires `enabled: true`) triggers an uninstall pod on every
  target node, running `uninstall.sh` / `uninstall-check.sh` from the package's
  ConfigMap (or the agentless equivalent) with the full package configuration
  (env, resources, volumes).
- **Interrupt after uninstall.** Packages with an `interrupt:` block (reboot,
  service restart, etc.) now run that interrupt *after* the uninstall pod
  completes, via a new `StageUninstallInterrupt` stage on `PackageStatus`. The
  new stage is distinct from the install-cycle `StageInterrupt` so the two can
  never be confused.
- **Finalizer-driven cleanup on CR delete.** Deleting a `Skyhook` CR now blocks
  on uninstall completion for every `enabled: true` package before the
  finalizer clears. Uncordon, labels, annotations, and per-node ConfigMaps are
  cleaned up automatically.
- **`UninstallInProgress` and `UninstallFailed` status conditions** report the
  state of in-flight uninstall work.
- **`Blocked` status condition** is emitted when a package depends on another
  package that is currently uninstalling (DAG dependency safety).
- **Spec-change pod recreation.** Editing an explicit-uninstall package's
  ConfigMap or env while the uninstall pod is failing causes the operator to
  recreate the pod with the new config — fixes can be rolled forward without
  manual pod deletion, even on a CR that is being deleted.

### Removed / changed behavior

- **Removing a package from `spec.packages` no longer triggers an uninstall.**
  For `enabled: false` (or unset) packages, the package's entry is **left in
  the node state annotation** (`skyhook.nvidia.com/nodeState_<name>`) — no
  uninstall pod runs and nothing on the node is cleaned up, so the persistent
  state entry signals to operators that the package's files are still on the
  node. For `enabled: true` packages, the webhook now **rejects** removal
  until the package has been explicitly uninstalled on all nodes.
- **Downgrades are gated.** The webhook rejects a version downgrade unless the
  OLD spec already had `uninstall.apply: true` AND the package is absent from
  every tracked node's state. The old "downgrade auto-triggers an uninstall
  pod" path is removed. For `enabled: false` packages, downgrades are accepted
  but the old version's node-state entry is preserved (D2 semantics: absent =
  cleanly uninstalled; non-absent = not cleanly uninstalled, just superseded).
  Upgrades are unchanged.
- **`apply: true` with `enabled: false`** is rejected by the webhook.

### Deprecations

- Deprecated prefixed Skyhook status condition types such as `skyhook.nvidia.com/Ready`, `skyhook.nvidia.com/Transition`, and `skyhook.nvidia.com/TaintNotTolerable`; bare condition types such as `Ready` and `TaintNotTolerable` are now emitted alongside the legacy names for one release.

### Migration

See [`docs/uninstall.md`](../docs/uninstall.md) for the API reference, workflow
examples, cancellation semantics, webhook rules, and migration guidance from
the previous remove-from-spec behavior.
