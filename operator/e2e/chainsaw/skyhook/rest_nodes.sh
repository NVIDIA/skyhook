## helper script
## clears labels and annotate from nodes with the prefix "skyhook.nvidia.com"
## note, a lot of tests have a label setup to target, so you might need to put that back
## example:
## ‚ùØ kubectl label node/kind-worker skyhook.nvidia.com/test-node=skyhooke2e

for node in $(kubectl get nodes -o name); do
    for anno in $(kubectl annotate --list ${node}); do
        [[ ${anno} =~ (^skyhook.nvidia.com\/.*)=.* ]] && kubectl annotate ${node} ${BASH_REMATCH[1]}-
    done
    for label in $(kubectl label --list ${node}); do
        [[ ${label} =~ (^skyhook.nvidia.com\/.*)=.* ]] && kubectl label ${node} ${BASH_REMATCH[1]}-
    done
done
