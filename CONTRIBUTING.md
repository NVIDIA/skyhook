# Contributing

Want to contribute to Skyhook (NodeWright)? We welcome bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests.

## Code of Conduct

This project is governed by the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating you are expected to uphold it. Report unacceptable behavior to GitHub_Conduct@nvidia.com. See [Community standards](#community-standards) for how reports are handled.

## Governance

Maintainers, decision-making, and the process for becoming a maintainer are documented in [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md) and [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md). Path-level review ownership is in [`.github/CODEOWNERS`](.github/CODEOWNERS).

## Filing Issues

- **Bug reports**: Use the [bug report template](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nodewright/issues/new?template=bug_report_form.yml).
- **Feature requests**: Use the [feature request template](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nodewright/issues/new?template=feature_request_form.yml).
- **Questions**: Use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nodewright/discussions).
- **Security vulnerabilities**: Do **not** file a public issue. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Claiming an Issue

Want to work on an issue? Claim it so others know it is taken. Comment on the issue and a bot will handle the assignment:

- `/assign`: assign the issue to yourself (only if it is currently unassigned).
- `/assign @user`: assign one other person (only if the issue is unassigned).
- `/unassign`: release your claim on the issue.

We use a single-owner model: an issue is assigned to at most one person. `/assign` is refused while the issue already has an assignee, and `/unassign` only ever removes your own claim, so nobody can drop someone else's. GitHub only lets you assign the commenter/self, someone who has commented on the issue, a user with write access, or an org member with read access; if a requested user cannot be assigned, the bot replies to say so.

## Pull Requests

### Open an issue first

Non-trivial changes start with an issue, not a pull request. Open one (or find an existing one), and wait for a maintainer to acknowledge it before you start writing code. The issue is where we confirm the change is wanted, agree on an approach, and tell you if something similar is already in flight — all of which are cheaper to sort out before you have a branch. A pull request that arrives with no linked, acknowledged issue may be closed and asked to start as one.

Two exceptions:

- **Trivial changes** — typo and formatting fixes, broken links, comment corrections — can go straight to a pull request.
- **Security vulnerabilities never start with a public issue.** Report them through [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) instead. PSIRT owns triage and the disclosure date and will coordinate the fix with you, including the pull request itself, so that nothing reveals the issue before the embargo lifts.

Reference the issue in your PR description (`closes #1234`) so it closes on merge. Note that this ONLY applies to public issues and PRs closing security MUST NOT reference the non-public security issue.

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes and ensure tests pass (`make test` in the relevant component directory).
3. Run `make fmt` to format code and add license headers.
4. When you bump a Go or Python dependency, run `make notices` and commit the refreshed `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` files alongside your change. See [`docs/contributing/release-process.md`](docs/contributing/release-process.md) for the workflow.
5. Commit with a [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) message and sign off (see below).
6. Open a pull request against `main`. The PR template will guide you through the checklist.

### Running the CI checks locally

Everything CI gates on can be run before you push. Run these from the component directory you touched:

```bash
# Operator / CLI (from operator/)
make unit-tests          # ginkgo unit tests + envtest — the fast inner loop
make lint                # golangci-lint + license check
make fmt                 # gofmt + license headers; CI fails if this leaves a diff
make test                # the full suite: unit + e2e + cli-e2e + helm + operator-agent

# Agent (from agent/)
make test                # hatch test with coverage
make fmt

# Repo-wide (from the root)
make license-header-check   # the same gate CI runs
```

`make test` in `operator/` is heavy — it runs four flavors of e2e and expects a running cluster (`make create-kind-cluster`). For iteration, `make unit-tests` is usually what you want; let CI run the rest.

Prefer the Makefile over raw `go test` / `golangci-lint` invocations. The targets encode `-mod=vendor`, license-header formatting, envtest setup, and CRD/deepcopy generation ordering; calling the tools directly skips some of that and produces drift. Run `make help` to see what is available.

### Dependency updates

Renovate owns Go module, Go toolchain, Python, and container dependency updates. Dependabot owns GitHub Actions updates because the token used by the self-hosted Renovate workflow cannot modify workflow files.

The `go` directives in `operator/go.mod` and `agent/go/go.mod` are the source of truth for the toolchain used by CI and release builds. Renovate updates both directives in one standalone pull request, then runs `go mod tidy` and `go mod vendor` so vendored builds remain reproducible.

Before changing `.github/renovate.json5`, run `make renovate-config-check`. The Renovate workflow can also be dispatched manually with `dryRun` enabled to inspect proposed updates without creating branches or pull requests.

Renovate uses the repository's `GITHUB_TOKEN`, not a PAT or GitHub App. GitHub therefore holds CI runs from Renovate-created pull requests for maintainer approval before they start.

### How your pull request gets reviewed

- **Reviewers are assigned automatically** from [`.github/CODEOWNERS`](.github/CODEOWNERS) based on the paths you touched. You do not need to find a reviewer yourself.
- **One approval from a code owner** for the affected paths is enough for most changes. Changes to a public contract — a CRD field, CLI flag, annotation, metric, or lifecycle semantics — additionally require approval from a maintainer who did not author the change.
- **All required checks must pass** before merge, and the branch must be up to date with `main`. Every gating workflow publishes a check named `ci-gate`; GitHub composes them into a single required status.
- **Decisions are made by lazy consensus.** A change is accepted if no maintainer raises a blocking objection within a reasonable review window — at least five business days for non-trivial changes. A maintainer blocking a change must give a concrete technical rationale and an actionable path forward. The full process, including how to escalate a disagreement, is in [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md#decision-making).
- **If your PR goes quiet**, comment on it — a ping is welcome and is the fastest way to get it moving. A bot also nudges the author on PRs with no activity for 14 days.

Review is a conversation, not a gate to get past. If you disagree with a review comment, say so and explain why; reviewers are expected to engage with the reasoning rather than insist.

### AI-Assisted Contributions Policy

We welcome the use of AI tools (e.g., Claude, GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT) to help you write code, brainstorm, or refactor. However, we maintain a strict human-in-the-loop policy for all submissions:

- **Full accountability**: By submitting a PR, you (the human author) accept full responsibility for the code: its correctness, security, maintainability, and license compliance. "The AI wrote it" is not an acceptable explanation for bugs or security flaws.
- **Understand what you submit**: Do not submit AI-generated code you do not fully understand. Reviewers expect you to explain and defend every line of code in your PR.
- **Follow the project rules**: Coding assistants must follow the guidance in [`.claude/CLAUDE.md`](.claude/CLAUDE.md) (symlinked as [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md)), including running `make fmt`, `make test`, and keeping `docs/` in sync.

## Extending NodeWright

Most new host behavior does **not** require changing the operator. NodeWright's primary extension point is a **package**: a container image the operator runs on each selected node, whose steps the agent executes through the lifecycle stages (uninstall, upgrade, apply, config, interrupt, post-interrupt).

### Writing a package

1. **Start with an existing generalist package.** [`NVIDIA/nodewright-packages`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nodewright-packages) publishes ready-made ones. The `shellscript` package runs commands you supply in the CR's `configMap` — no image build at all. [`examples/simple/scr.yaml`](examples/simple/scr.yaml) is a working example.
2. **Build your own when you need more.** A package image ships its step scripts plus a `/skyhook-package/config.json` that the agent validates and dispatches on. The agent runs steps inside the host root mount and writes completion flags so finished stages are skipped on re-run.
3. **Version it with SemVer.** This is not cosmetic: the operator compares package versions to decide upgrade vs. downgrade vs. fresh apply, so a package that misreports its version will take the wrong lifecycle path.
4. **Consume secrets at runtime**, never baked into the image — see [`docs/user-guide/providing-secrets.md`](docs/user-guide/providing-secrets.md).

Package *contents* live with their authors rather than in this repository — see [Project Scope](GOVERNANCE.md#project-scope).

### Extension points inside this repository

If you are changing NodeWright itself rather than writing a package:

- **A new interrupt type** implements the agent's `Interrupt` contract — `Type` for the wire identity, `Run` for execution against an `execution.Config`, `Serialize` for the operator-facing form. Retry state and completion flags stay outside the interrupt. See the execution-contract notes in [`agent/README.md`](agent/README.md).
- **A new CLI subcommand** goes under `operator/cmd/cli/app/` and talks to the cluster through `operator/internal/cli/client`, not the apiserver directly. Anything version-gated must also land in the compatibility matrix in [`docs/user-guide/cli.md`](docs/user-guide/cli.md).
- **A new CRD field** requires `make manifests generate`, mirrored edits in both `operator/config/` and `chart/`, and a docs update in the same PR.

In every case, find the nearest existing example and match it. A new pattern that has no precedent in the target package should be called out explicitly in your PR description — what you introduced, why the existing patterns didn't fit, and why it should become the convention.

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for the patch. Your
signature certifies that you wrote the patch or otherwise have the right to pass
it on as an open-source patch. The rules are pretty simple: if you can certify
the below (from [developercertificate.org](http://developercertificate.org/)):

```
Developer Certificate of Origin
Version 1.1

Copyright (C) 2004, 2006 The Linux Foundation and its contributors.
1 Letterman Drive
Suite D4700
San Francisco, CA, 94129

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
    this project or the open source license(s) involved.
```

Then you just add a line to every git commit message:

```
Signed-off-by: Joe Smith <joe.smith@email.com>
```

Use your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions.)

If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` git configs, you can sign your
commit automatically with `git commit -s`.

## Code Style

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for our commit messages.

### Python (Agent)

We use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for Python code style.
For testing, we use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/).

### Golang (Operator / CLI)

We use [gofmt](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/gofmt) for Golang code style.
For testing, we use [Ginkgo](https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo) and [Gomega](https://github.com/onsi/gomega).

## License Header

We use `scripts/format_license.py` to add the license header to the code.

```bash
make license-fmt
```

This adds the license header based on the LICENSE file and removes/replaces any existing header. Component Makefiles also run this automatically via `make fmt`.

## Community standards

We enforce the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in every project space: issues, pull requests, discussions, and any venue where someone is representing NodeWright.

### Reporting

Send reports to GitHub_Conduct@nvidia.com. Include what happened, where, when, and links if the incident is public. You do not need to be the target of the behavior to report it.

### Response timeline

- **Acknowledgement within 3 business days.** You get a confirmation that the report was received and who is handling it.
- **Resolution within 14 business days** for most reports. If an investigation needs longer, we tell you that before day 14 and give an updated estimate.
- **Immediate action** for ongoing harassment, threats, or doxxing, ahead of the full investigation.

Reporter identity is shared only with the people investigating. Outcomes follow the [Enforcement Guidelines](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#enforcement-guidelines) ladder: correction, warning, temporary ban, permanent ban.

### Out of scope

The following are handled elsewhere, not through a conduct report:

- **Security vulnerabilities**: see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). Do not file a public issue.
- **Technical disagreements**, including rejected pull requests and design decisions you disagree with. Escalate through the process in [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md#decision-making).
- **Conduct in venues unrelated to NodeWright**, unless it creates a credible safety risk for someone in this community.
- **NVIDIA employment or HR matters**, which go through NVIDIA's internal channels.
